Learning:
- How Git works with GitHub to manage versions and collaborate.
- Using commits and pushing changes to a remote repository.
- Creating branches and understanding the GitHub flow.

Maybe something not so clear:
- When exactly to use forks vs. branches in real-world projects.
- How to resolve merge conflicts properly.

Feedback:
The course is well-structured and beginner-friendly!
